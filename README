munin-node is the client portion of the Munin Monitoring system. It allows the 
Munin master to collect statistics for presentation in RRDTool time-series
graphs.

munin-node is a Perl application and requires several Perl modules as external
dependencies:

	Time::HiRes
	Net::Server
	Net::SSLeay (for SSL connections)

Additionally, the following modules are required for some plugins:

	Net::SNMP
	Net::CIDR

Munin requires that user munin exists and belongs to group munin. Create these
before running the SlackBuild script:

groupadd -g 434 munin
useradd -u 434 -g 434 -s /sbin/nologin munin

Once munin-node is installed, configure plugins per the Munin documentation.
